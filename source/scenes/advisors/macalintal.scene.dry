= Leon Macalintal


Leon Macalintal is the current Gucklandian Interior Minister and is part of the original party trio of McGucket, Macalintal, and<span class="tooltip-new"><span class="tooltiptext"><img src="img/portraits/WelsOtto.jpg" alt="Remma">[+ remma_description +]</span> Remma</span>. A member of the NPP-Radikal, he believes in no compromise with any bourgeois parties in contrast to the NPP-Center. Instead, he supports building up our support base of the urban proletariat and making grassroots organization more expansive.

He cooperates closely with the NPP-Anarchists, and has a close working relations with its caucus leader: Clueless Partisan. Macalintal is known to be scheming and is expert with realpolitik in Ateneocord. As one of the more dominant older personalities of the NPP, he has clashed with Yuuto and Blooky in the past, making Davaoenos slightly negative towards him.

After Yuuto's ousting, Macalintal does not oppose the TKDP coalition plans unlike many in his caucus like McGucket who calls them "Yuuto's lapdogs" as they were instrumental in keeping him in power. He is not, however, fully accepting yet until the TKDP can shrug off its Yuutoist past properly.
