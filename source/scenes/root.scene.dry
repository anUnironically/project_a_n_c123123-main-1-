Ateneocord in 2020 is at the center of change, the right-populism that once ruled the political structure has been pushed out. Reactionaries hold on to dear life for a comeback. The air is silent, for the first time in history, there is no one firmly at the helm. The throne in heaven, empty. The NPPs new beginning starts now, their power only slipping away as time progresses. Can *we* harness that change?

The atmosphere is damp. Somewhere in the city, in a tall building, a man sits in a dark room. Faint light spills over the window curtains to his table, illuminating a red phone. He‚Äôs here, hiding, not wanting to let anyone else know. A noise shoots out. It‚Äôs the phone.

Ring. Ring. Ring. The man stares at the phone intently. He won‚Äôt answer it. At least not for now.

Ring. Ring. Ring.

This is a story about a group, a group who embody and desire change. A friend group that believed in the hope of others, in the fact that things *can* turn out for the better. This is how a group viewed people at home and abroad as humans, and how they struggled deciding between breaking off and changing within.

This is a story about redemption, about love, and about hate. Most importantly, this symbolizes my appreciation for the NPP.

Of course, this is all fictional. The times and events were adjusted for this game to work, but allow me to lead you to believe in things that never were.

If you don‚Äôt know us, and you decide to laugh and point, just know this love letter wasn't intended for you.
